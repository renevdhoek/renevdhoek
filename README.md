### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating software and extending technologies that can help in any way possible. Some technologies I enjoy working with include DotNet, Vue, Blazor, SVG, and many others.  

Underneath I created a personal roadmap to keep track of all topics that might increase my knowledge and skills
